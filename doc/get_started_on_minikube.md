# Get started on minikube

This document describes how to deploy Chaos Mesh in Kubernetes on your laptop (Linux or macOS) using minikube.

## Prerequisites

Before deployment, make sure [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) 
is installed on your local machine.

## Step 1: Set up the Kubernetes environment

Take the following steps to set up the local Kubernetes environment:

1. Start a `minikube` kubernetes cluster. Make sure you have installed [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/).

   ```bash
   minikube start --kubernetes-version v1.15.0 --cpus 4 --memory "8192mb" # we recommend that you allocate enough RAM (more than 8192 MiB) to the VM
   ```

2. Install Helm

   ```bash
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get | bash
   helm init
   ```

3. Check whether the Helm tiller pod is running.

   ```bash
   kubectl -n kube-system get pods -l app=helm
   ```

## Step 2: Install Chaos Mesh

Run the following comments to install Chaos Mesh;

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/pingcap/chaos-mesh && \
cd chaos-mesh
./install.sh
```

>**Note:** 
>
> `install.sh` is a shell script to automate the installation process. To deploy manually,  refer to [Install Chaos Mesh manually](deploy.md).

After executing the above commands, you should be able to see the prompt that Chaos Mesh is installed successfully. Otherwise, please check the current environment according to the prompt message or send us an [issue](https://github.com/pingcap/chaos-mesh/issues) for help. 

> **Limitations:**
>
> There are some known restrictions for Chaos Operator deployed on `minikube` clusters:
> - `netem chaos` is only supported for `minikube` clusters >= version 1.6.
>
>   In `minikube`, the default virtual machine driver's image doesn't contain the `sch_netem` kernel module in smaller versions. You can use `none` driver (if your host is Linux with the `sch_netem` kernel module loaded) to try these chaos actions on `minikube` or [build an image with sch_netem by yourself](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/contributing/iso/).
